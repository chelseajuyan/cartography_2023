# Welcome to Our Codebase! 🗺


### This is a repository for all the code and materials used to make our maps and visualizations for the class GEOG0162 Cartography and Data Visualization at University College London.
By: Matthew Lam, Chelsea Ju, Yilin Xu, Eddie Houghton


Every week, we worked as a group to create a map or data visualization
on an assigned topic. We use a lot of R and QGIS for data wrangling and
GIS; Blender for 3D visualizations and Illustrator to put everything
together. All the data we used are open-source or publicly available.

Here’s what we produced each week:

| Theme                                                                                                                        | Visualisation                                                                             |
